As previously shown, male subscribers are the overwhelming majority of users all days of the week but espically during the core workdays - Monday through Friday.

## Summary
Based upon the available data, bike rental was of definite use within New York City.  The rentals are overwhelmingly male and based upon data used as a method of commutuing as the heaviest use is during 8am and 5pm rush hours.  The majority of users are also subscribers so bike renting can be a perpetual sources of revenue.  

Two potential areas of additional analysis would be:

1) The amount of distance the bicycles are used.  Are they used to go blocks or miles?  This will help determine if Des Moines should limit the bicycles to certain areas of the city.

2) Age of users.  Determining age range of users could help to decide where the bicycles are located and/or if the city's populations skews elderly and, hypothetically, the elderly don't use the bikes, then the bikes may not be the best investment.
